## Overview

WhizoAI provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables seamless integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible AI tools. This allows you to use WhizoAI's web scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities directly within your AI assistant conversations.

<Info>
  **MCP Server Package**: [`whizoai-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whizoai-mcp) - Published on npm
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- WhizoAI API key ([Get your API key](https://whizo.ai/app/api-keys))
- Claude Desktop or another MCP-compatible tool

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get Your API Key

1. Log in to your [WhizoAI Dashboard](https://whizo.ai/app)
2. Navigate to [API Keys](https://whizo.ai/app/api-keys)
3. Copy your existing API key or create a new one

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "whizoai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "whizoai-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WHIZOAI_API_KEY": "wai_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Replace `wai_your_api_key_here` with your actual WhizoAI API key from the dashboard.
</Warning>

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

After saving the configuration file, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

### 4. Verify Installation

In Claude Desktop, you should now see the WhizoAI MCP server listed in the available tools. You can verify by asking:

```
Can you scrape https://example.com for me?
```

## Configuration Options

### Custom API URL

If you're using a self-hosted WhizoAI instance or testing locally, you can specify a custom API URL:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "whizoai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "whizoai-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WHIZOAI_API_KEY": "wai_your_api_key_here",
        "WHIZOAI_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple Environments

You can configure multiple WhizoAI MCP servers for different environments:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "whizoai-prod": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "whizoai-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WHIZOAI_API_KEY": "wai_production_key"
      }
    },
    "whizoai-dev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "whizoai-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WHIZOAI_API_KEY": "wai_development_key",
        "WHIZOAI_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Credit Usage

MCP tool calls consume credits from your WhizoAI account based on the operation:

| Tool | Base Cost | Additional |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `whizoai_scrape` | 1 credit | +1 for screenshot, +1 for PDF |
| `whizoai_crawl` | 1 credit/page | Depends on pages crawled |
| `whizoai_extract` | 3-6 credits/page | Based on AI model used |
| `whizoai_search` | 1 credit | Per search query |
| `whizoai_map` | 1 credit | Per discovery request |
| Other tools | Free | No credit cost |

<Tip>
  Monitor your credit usage from the [Dashboard](https://whizo.ai/app) or use the `whizoai_check_credits` tool in Claude.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Loading

1. **Check Configuration Path**: Ensure you're editing the correct config file
2. **Validate JSON**: Use a JSON validator to check for syntax errors
3. **Restart Claude**: Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop
4. **Check Logs**: View MCP server logs in Claude Desktop's developer console

### API Key Issues

1. **Verify API Key**: Ensure your API key is active in the [Dashboard](https://whizo.ai/app/api-keys)
2. **Check Format**: API keys should start with `wai_`
3. **Permissions**: Ensure the key has appropriate permissions

### Connection Errors

1. **Network**: Verify you have internet connectivity
2. **Firewall**: Check if firewall is blocking npx or Node.js
3. **API Status**: Check [status.whizo.ai](https://status.whizo.ai) for service health

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimize Credit Usage">
    - Use `onlyMainContent: true` for scraping to reduce costs
    - Limit crawl depth and pages to only what you need
    - Use `whizoai_map` to discover URLs before crawling
    - Cache results when possible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Rate Limits">
    - Monitor your plan's rate limits in the dashboard
    - Use batch operations instead of sequential individual requests
    - Implement exponential backoff for retries
    - Upgrade your plan if you consistently hit limits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secure Your API Key">
    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Rotate API keys periodically
    - Use separate keys for development and production
    - Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Usage

### Using with Other MCP Clients

While this guide focuses on Claude Desktop, the WhizoAI MCP server works with any MCP-compatible client:

```bash
# Run directly with node
npx -y whizoai-mcp

# Or install globally
npm install -g whizoai-mcp
whizoai-mcp
```

### Local Development

For local development and testing:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "whizoai-local": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "whizoai-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WHIZOAI_API_KEY": "wai_test_key",
        "WHIZOAI_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
