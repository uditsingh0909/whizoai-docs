      "format": "markdown"
    }

    }
  }
  ```

**Action 3**: Google Sheets - Create Spreadsheet Row

- URL: `https://api.whizo.ai/v1/batch`
- Data:
  ```json
  {
    "urls": ["{{airtable_url1}}", "{{airtable_url2}}", "{{airtable_url3}}"],
    "options": {
      "format": "markdown"
    }
  }
  ```

**Action 2**: Delay by Zapier
- Wait: `2 minutes` (for batch to complete)

**Action 3**: Webhooks by Zapier - GET
- URL: `https://api.whizo.ai/v1/jobs/{{job_id}}/results`
- Headers: `Authorization: Bearer whizo_YOUR-API-KEY`

**Action 4**: Airtable - Update Record
- Record ID: `{{trigger_record_id}}`
- Field: `Scraped Content` = `{{job_results}}`
- Field: `Status` = `Completed`

### 4. RSS Feed → Scrape Articles → Send Email Digest

**Use Case**: Monitor industry blogs, scrape new articles, send weekly digest.

**Trigger**: RSS by Zapier - New Item in Feed

**Action 1**: Webhooks by Zapier - POST
- URL: `https://api.whizo.ai/v1/scrape`
- Data:
  ```json
  {

    }
  }
  ```

**Action 2**: Webhooks by Zapier - POST (Summarize with AI)

- Data:
  ```json
  {
    "content": "{{scraped_content}}",
    "schema": {
      "summary": "3-sentence summary of the article",
      "key_points": "Main takeaways (array of strings)",
      "relevant": "Is this relevant to AI/ML? (boolean)"
    }
  }
  ```

**Filter**: Only Continue If `{{extracted_relevant}}` is `true`

**Action 3**: Gmail - Send Email
- To: `your@email.com`
- Subject: `Weekly Industry Digest - {{rss_item_title}}`
- Body:
  ```
  {{rss_item_title}}
  {{rss_item_link}}

  Summary: {{extracted_summary}}

  Key Points:
  {{extracted_key_points}}

  Full Content:
  {{scraped_content}}
  ```

## Advanced Patterns

### Webhook-Driven Scraping

Use WhizoAI webhooks with Zapier for real-time notifications:

**Step 1**: Create Webhook in WhizoAI
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.whizo.ai/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer whizo_YOUR-API-KEY" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/",
    "events": ["job.completed", "job.failed"]
  }'
```

**Step 2**: Create Zap with Webhook Trigger
- **Trigger**: Webhooks by Zapier - Catch Hook
- **Action**: Process the webhook payload

**Example - Job Completion Handler**:
- Trigger: Catch Hook
- Filter: Only continue if `event` equals `job.completed`
- Action: Send to Slack/Email/Database based on results

### Error Handling

Add error handling to your Zaps:

**Action**: Paths by Zapier
- Path A: If `{{webhook_status}}` is `200`
  - Continue with normal workflow
- Path B: If `{{webhook_status}}` is not `200`
  - Send error notification
  - Log to error tracking tool

### Multi-Step Extraction

For complex data extraction:

**Action 1**: Scrape page
**Action 2**: Extract structured data with AI
**Action 3**: Scrape related pages (using extracted URLs)
**Action 4**: Combine and format data
**Action 5**: Save to destination

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
Be mindful of WhizoAI rate limits based on your plan:

- **Free**: 10 requests/hour
- **Starter**: 50 requests/hour
- **Pro**: 200 requests/hour

Use Zapier's "Delay" action to control request rate:
```
Trigger → Delay (6 minutes) → Scrape
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Credit Management">
Monitor credit usage:
- Check credits before running large batches
- Use webhooks to get alerts when credits are low
- Set up monthly budget alerts in WhizoAI dashboard
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Error Handling">
Always include error paths:

1. Add a "Filter" step to check response status
2. Create separate paths for success/failure
3. Log errors to a tracking tool
4. Send notifications for failures
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Storage">
Store results efficiently:
- Short-term: Zapier Storage (limited)
- Long-term: Google Sheets, Airtable, Database
- Large files: Save to Google Drive or Dropbox
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
