# API Keys

API keys provide secure access to the WhizoAI scraping platform. Each key grants programmatic access to all endpoints with configurable rate limits and permissions.

## Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to the [API Keys dashboard](https://whizo.ai/app/api-keys)
2. Click "Create New API Key"
3. Set a descriptive name for identification
4. Configure rate limits and permissions
5. Copy the generated key immediately (it won't be shown again)

## Authentication

Include your API key in requests using the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer whizo_sk_..." \
  https://api.whizo.ai/v1/scrape
```

## Best Practices

- **Never expose API keys** in client-side code or public repositories
- **Use environment variables** to store keys securely
- **Set appropriate rate limits** based on your usage patterns
- **Rotate keys regularly** for enhanced security
- **Use different keys** for development and production environments

## Rate Limits

| Plan | Requests/Hour | Requests/Day |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Free | 10 | 100 |
| Starter | 50 | 500 |
| Pro | 200 | 2,000 |
| Enterprise | 1,000 | 10,000 |

## Managing API Keys

- **View Usage**: Monitor API key usage and analytics
- **Update Limits**: Modify rate limits and permissions
- **Revoke Access**: Immediately disable compromised keys
- **Track Activity**: View detailed request logs and history
